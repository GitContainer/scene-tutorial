camera_roll_resize
==================

Pythonista-script to modify resolution, mode and quality of a camera roll picture and save a copy


Example:
========

Picture-Information: resolution = 1936 x 2592 (5.0 MP), mode = RGBA

!!! Changing the resolution is time-consuming !!! Resolution higher 6000 x 4000 (24MP) can cause a abend!

0 = Auto processing (Resolution = 1936 x 2592, quality = 95%, mode = RGBA)
1 = Same resolution (1936 x 2592)
2 = Define resolution
3 = 3MP (2048 x 1536)
5 = 5MP (2592 x 1936)
Resolution: 2

Changing the ratio causes picture deformation!
Width: 800
Height: 600

Quality (0 - 100): 90

0 = no change (RGBA)
1 = black/white
2 = grey
3 = RGB no transparency
4 = RGB with transparency
5 = CMYK
6 = YCbCr
7 = 32bit Pixel
Mode: 0

Picture is in process ...
Completed!
Resolution = 800 x 600, quality = 90%, mode = RGBA
